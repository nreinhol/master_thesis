\subsection{Components}
\label{sec:components_of_simulation}
To start, this subsection presents the respective main components 
that interact with each other during the runtime of the simulation.
However, the individual components are considered in isolation in this subsection.

\subsubsection{Agent}
\label{sec:agent_class}
The agents are implemented by a Python class. Moreover, the naming is oriented on the proposed \textit{BTM} and,
as mentioned earlier in section \ref{sec:concept_of_lem}, the agents represent the respective household 
in the LEM simulation.
To begin with, the class attributes are presented. 
The associated source code can be seen in the following listing \ref{lst:agent_class_attributes}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:agent_class_attributes, caption=Overview of the agent class attributes, language=Python]
    class Agent(object):

    def __init__(self, agent_number, account_address, web3, dealer_contract):
        self._name = 'AGENT{}'.format(agent_number)
        self._account_address = account_address
        self._web3 = web3
        self._dealer_contract = dealer_contract
        self._optimization_problem = None
        self._bundle_set = None
        self._bid = None
        self._mkt_prices = None
        self._trade = None
        self._objective = None
        self._wealth = None
        self._accept_trade = None
\end{lstlisting}

The variables \verb|agent_number|, \verb|account_address|, \verb|web3| and \verb|dealer_contract| are initialized when the class is instantiated.
The variable \verb|agent_number| is attached to the name of the respective agent and serves as an identifier. 
Otherwise the variable \verb|account_address| could be used to identify the agents, 
but it would be cumbersome due to the cryptic hexadecimal representation of the blockchain account addresses.
Therefore a more understandable name for each agent is established.
Furthermore, each agent is assigned an Ethereum blockchain account defined by the variable \verb|account_address|. It is required to submit and 
receive transactions via the blockchain.
Moreover, the variable \verb|web3| represents the Python library for interacting with an Ethereum blockchain, which is already introduced in section \ref{sec:applied_technologies}.
The last variable which is initialized on instantiation is the \verb|dealer_contract|. 
This variable contains an object of the smart contract dealer. This object knows all the implemented functions of the dealer's smart contract.
Hence, this variable is needed to call the functions of the smart contract out of this Python class.
All other class attributes are set immediately after the instantiation or during the running simulation. 

Next, some of the most important functions of the class are introduced and explained.
After the instantiation, each agent gets their optimization problem. In the listing \ref{lst:lp_setter} below, the implementation 
of the setter is shown.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:lp_setter, caption=Setter of optimization problem, language=Python]
    @optimization_problem.setter
    def optimization_problem(self, value):
        self._optimization_problem = value
        self._objective = self._optimization_problem.solve().fun
        self._wealth = self.balance + abs(self._objective)
\end{lstlisting}

As you can see in the listing, after setting the optimization problem, the class attributes \verb|objective| and \verb|wealth| are determined.
In this case, the attribute \verb|wealth| is defined as the sum of the current \verb|balance| of the account and the absolute value of the current \verb|objective|.
Equally, it is defined in the \textit{BTM}, outlined in section \ref{sec:btm}.
However, \verb|balance| is not a class attribute, but a class function. It uses the class attributes \verb|web3| and \verb|account_address| to retrieve the current
balance of the account from the blockchain.

In addition, the function for determining the improving bundle set and the associated bid is introduced in the listing \ref{lst:determine_bundle}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:determine_bundle, caption=Determining of bundle attributes, language=Python]
    def determine_bundle_attributes(self):
        result = solve_bundle_determination(self._optimization_problem, self._mkt_prices)
        self._bundle_set = result.x
        self._bid = self._objective - result.fun
\end{lstlisting}

As shown in the listing, first the bundle determination problem is solved.
It is solved in a separate function which requires the optimization problem and the current market prices as parameters.
Further, the class attributes \verb|bundle_set| and \verb|bid| are initialized.
We stated in section \ref{sec:agent_bidding} that the applied market mechanism implemented nonstrategic bidding and pricing, wherefore 
an agent always submits a limit price equal to the valuation of the bundle. 
This is reflected in the definition of the class attribute \verb|bid|. The true value of the improving \verb|bundle_set| 
is the current \verb|objective| minus the objective of the optimization problem with the resources of the \verb|bundle_set|.
In this case, the minus sign reflects the fact that we are minimizing costs.
After presenting the determination of all necessary bundle attributes, the submitting of an order is shown in the listing \ref{lst:set_order} below.
First of all, the variables \verb|bundle_set| and \verb|bid| are prepared for sending to the dealer's smart contract.
In Solidity, fixed point numbers are not fully supported yet. It is possible to declare them, but they cannot be assigned to or from \shortcite{solidity_fixed_point}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:set_order, caption=Submitting of order, language=Python]
    def set_order(self):
        bundle_set = utils.prepare_for_sending(self._bundle_set)
        bid = utils.prepare_for_sending(self._bid)
        
        if(bid > 0):
            prepayment = utils.from_ether_to_wei(self._bid)
        else:
            prepayment = 0

        self._dealer_contract.contract.functions.setOrder(bundle_set, bid, prepayment).transact({'from': self._account_address, 'value': prepayment})
\end{lstlisting}

Therefore, we developed a workaround that shift the decimal place two digits to the right and cuts off the remainder,
so that you receive integer values. 

Additionally, the variable \verb|prepayment| is assigned. 
The condition that \verb|bid| is greater than zero identifies if this order represents a buy order.
In case of a buy order, the agents have to pay in advance.
Therefore the value of \verb|prepayment| is set equal to the value of variable \verb|bid|. 
This procedure is implemented to prevent the strategic placing of orders and to ensure that the financial resources are available.
If it is a sell order, no payment in advance is required and the value of \verb|prepayment| is set to zero.
Furthermore, before the value of \verb|prepayment| is equated with the value of \verb|bid|, a function is called that converts the value of \verb|bid|. This function converts the input values from the unit Ether to the unit
Wei. 
The implementation of this function is required because Wei is the base unit for currency in Solidity
and all monetary values within a contract are given in it. However, on the client side, we decided to specify all monetary values in Ether
for better clarity.

Finally, the already introduced class attribute \verb|dealer_contract| is used to call the function of the dealer's smart contract which is
responsible for setting the orders.

Furthermore, the class provides a function to evaluate the published market prices of the dealer. 
This function is implemented to verify if the dealer has calculated the prices of the respective trades 
correctly.  

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:verify_trade, caption=Verification of trades, language=Python]
    def verify_strong_duality(self):
        mmp_values, mmp_duals, mmp_target_coefs, mmp_bounds = self.get_mmp_attributes()
        primal_solution = (-np.sum(mmp_values * mmp_target_coefs))
        dual_solution = np.sum(mmp_duals * mmp_bounds)
        primal_solution = math.floor(primal_solution * 10) / 10
        dual_solution = math.floor(dual_solution * 10) / 10

        if primal_solution == dual_solution:
            self._accept_trade = True
        else:
            self._accept_trade = False
\end{lstlisting}

The related source code of this function can be seen in the listing \ref{lst:verify_trade} above. 
To begin with, the function retrieves the values of the primal \textit{market matching problem} and
the belonging dual problem from the dealer's smart contract. For the verification of the correctness, the introduced \textit{Strong Duality Theorem}
in section \ref{sec:strong_duality_theorem} is applied. 
Due to this, it is possible to verify if the solution of the dealer is optimal, without solving the corresponding
\textit{market matching problem}.
To apply the \textit{Strong Duality Theorem}, the solution of the primal problem (represented by variable \verb|primal_solution|) is calculated
on the one hand, and the solution of the dual problem (represented by variable \verb|dual_solution|) on the other hand.
Additionally, both solutions are rounded to one decimal place. This procedure is implemented due to the issues and limitations of 
floating point arithmetic \footnote{https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html}. 
We want to make sure that correct trades are not rejected based on those limitations.
Finally, it is examined if both solutions are identical. If this is the case, the class variable \verb|accept_trade| of type boolean is
set to \verb|True|, otherwise to \verb|False|.

Likewise, the class provides a function to notify the dealer's smart contract if the respective trade is accepted or not.
The implementation of this function is shown in listing \ref{lst:accept_trade}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:accept_trade, caption=Notification of trade acceptance, language=Python]
    def accept_trade(self):
        if(self._accept_trade):
            trade = self._dealer_contract.contract.functions.acceptTrade(self._accept_trade).call({'from': self._account_address})
            self._trade = utils.prepare_for_storing(trade)

        self._dealer_contract.contract.functions.acceptTrade(self._accept_trade).transact({'from': self._account_address})

\end{lstlisting}

If the verification of the \textit{Strong Duality Theorem} was successful and the variable \verb|acccept_trade| was thus set to the value \verb|True|,
the function retrieves the trade and stores it in the class attribute \verb|trade|. Besides, before the trade is stored, it is 
prepared for storing. This is due to the already mentioned workaround that shift the decimal place two digits to the right before 
sending values to the dealer's smart contract. When retrieving and storing values, exactly the opposite is done and we shift the decimal place 
two digits to the left. 

Furthermore, as you can see in the listing \ref{lst:accept_trade} above, an almost 
identical function invocation of the dealer's smart contract 
function \verb|acceptTrade()| is indicated twice. 
The difference lies in the expressions \verb|call()| and \verb|transact()|. 
The \verb|call()| method of the Web3.py library enables to invoke any smart contract function on a read-only basis
and returns values sent by the smart contract return statement. 
Those read-only invocations run much faster than transactions that require network verification.
On the contrary, the \verb|transact()| method submits a verified transaction that potentially changes the state of the blockchain. 
Hence, network verification is needed that causes a significant delay due to the mining procedure.
Consequently, this method does not return the values of the smart contract return statements,
but the transaction hash of the submitted verified transaction.
Regarding the implementation, the first invocation only serves to preserve the respective bundle,
whereas the second call of the function serves to notify the dealer whether the trade has been accepted or not.
For this reason, the first call of the dealer's smart contract function \verb|acceptTrade()| 
is only executed if the trade is accepted. 

Finally, a last class function is described. This function adds the received trade to the shared resources
as it is defined in the \textit{BTM}, introduced in the section \ref{sec:market_clearing_mechanism}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:add_trade_to_shared_resources, caption=Adding of trade to shared resources, language=Python]
    def add_trade_to_shared_resources(self):
        if(self._accept_trade):
            self._optimization_problem.shared_resources = np.add(self._optimization_problem.shared_resources, self._trade)
            self._objective = self._optimization_problem.solve().fun  
            self._wealth = self.balance + abs(self._objective)
\end{lstlisting}

As shown in the listing \ref{lst:add_trade_to_shared_resources} above, the code of the function 
is only executed if the trade has been accepted. 
In addition, the new \verb|objective| of the linear programming model is calculated after getting the new resources.
Since a new \verb|objective| has been calculated, the class attribute \verb|wealth| is also recalculated accordingly.



\subsubsection{Smart contract dealer}
\label{sec:smart_contract_dealer}
In this part, the dealer's smart contract is introduced. 
As already mentioned, the contract is implemented by the programming language Solidity. 
First of all, attributes of the contract are presented in the following listing \ref{lst:contract_attributes}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:contract_attributes, caption=Attributes of Smart Contract, language=Java]
    contract Dealer{
        // general attributes
        address private _owner;
        int256[] public resource_inventory;
        int256[] public mkt_prices;

        // attributes for order management
        uint32 public order_count;
        uint32[] public order_indices;
        mapping(uint32 => Order) public orders;

        // attributes for trade management
        mapping (address => uint256) account_index; 
        address[] public trades_accounts;
        mapping(address => int256[]) public trades;
        mapping(address => uint256) public bills;
        mapping(address => uint256) public prepayments;
        mapping(address => uint256) public refunds;
\end{lstlisting}

First, general attributes are declared. As you can see, the contract contains an attribute called \verb|owner|.
This variable is set in the constructor of the contract and initialized with the address of the contract creator,
which is, in this case, the off-chain dealer.  
It is being used in a modifier which ensures that certain functions can only be executed by the owner of the contract.
Moreover, a modifier can be seen as an extension of a function and is mainly used to 
to check if certain conditions are met before executing the rest of the source code in the body of a function.

In addition, attributes for managing the orders and trades of the agents are declared. 
The orders, trades and additional properties of the trades are predominantly managed in mappings.
A mapping is a collection of key-value pairs. All of the keys have to be of the same data type, and 
all values must be of the same data type. However, Solidity does not provide an iteration
function to retrieve all the lists that are stored in a mapping. 
That is to say, it is not possible to read the values from the mapping without knowing the respective keys.
Therefore, we developed a workaround and store the keys of mappings in additional arrays which serves 
as look up tables.
With reference to the listing \ref{lst:contract_attributes}, the array \verb|order_indices| functions as a 
lookup table for the mapping \verb|orders|, and the array \verb|trades_accounts| for the mapping 
\verb|trades| and all other trades related mappings.

Next, some of the most important functions of the dealer's smart contract are introduced and explained.

To begin with, the function for receiving the order of the agents is outlined in the listing \ref{lst:set_order_contract}.
The function header contains, on the one hand, the Solidity built-in modifier \verb|payable|, and on the other hand, the custom
modifier \verb|checkPrepayment|. A function declared with \verb|payable| is one that can accept incoming payments. 
Without the declaration, the function would reject payments and throw an exception. In this case, the modifier is required 
to receive the prepayments of the agents. 
Further, we developed the second modifier \verb|checkPrepayment| to verify whether the incoming payment match the amount
of required prepayment.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:set_order_contract, caption=Receiving agents orders, language=Java]
    function setOrder(int256[] _bundle, uint256 _bid, uint256 _prepayment) public payable checkPrepayment(_prepayment) {

        Order memory new_order = Order(
            msg.sender,
            _bundle,
            _bid
        );
        orders[order_count] = new_order;
        order_indices.push(order_count);

        // increment order count
        order_count ++;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Hence, if the prepayment is not sufficient, the function call of the agents is rejected and 
the order is not accepted.

Next, an \verb|Order| object is declared and initialized. The order object is implemented by the data type
struct. It is a user-defined data container for grouping variables.
This data type is well suited to bundle and manage all necessary information regarding an order.
In this case, the object \verb|Order| contains the variables \verb|msg.sender|, \verb|bundle| and \verb|bid|.
The variables \verb|bundle| and \verb|bid| are passed as function parameters.
Besides, when a contract is executed, it has access to a small set of global objects. 
One of these objects represents the \verb|msg| object. It is the transaction call that launched the contract execution.
Therefore, the account address of the agent who executed the function call can be reached via the \verb|msg.sender| variable
contained in the \verb|msg| object.

Finally, the \verb|Order| object is added to the mapping \verb|orders|.
The variable \verb|order_count| is an incremental number that serves as the key for 
the mapping \verb|orders|. After each incoming order, this number is increased by one. 
Additionally, the variable \verb|order_count| is added to the array \verb|oder_indices|
that serves as a lookup table as mentioned earlier.

Furthermore, the contract function which serves to set the trades of the agents is introduced in listing \ref{lst:set_trade_contract}.
With reference to the function header, the modifier \verb|onlyByOwner()| is applied.
This custom modifier examines if the caller of the function is also the owner of the contract. This means, that 
only the owner of the contract has the permission to call this function.
The owner of the contract is the off-chain dealer. Accordingly, the applied modifier ensures that no one else can set 
the trades. 

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:set_trade_contract, caption=Setting the trades, language=Java]
    function setTrade(address _account, int256[] _trade, uint256 _prepayment, uint256 _bill, uint256 _refund) public onlyByOwner() {
        addToArray(_account);
        trades[_account] = _trade;
        bills[_account] = _bill;
        prepayments[_account] = _prepayment;
        refunds[_account] = _refund;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Next, the function \verb|addToArray()| is called and the variable \verb|account| is passed. 
This function checks whether the account to which the trade belongs is already contained in the array \verb|trades_account|.
If not, the function adds the account to the array, which again serves as the lookup table for the
mapping \verb|trades| and all other trades related mappings.
Concluding, all the required information for a trade is placed in the corresponding mappings. In all
mappings the account address is used as the key.

In the end, a last function of the dealer's smart contract is introduced.
The implementation of the function is shown in listing \ref{lst:accept_trade_contract} above
and can be seen as a kind of collection point for the trades.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:accept_trade_contract, caption=Collection point of trades, language=Java]
    function acceptTrade(bool accept_trade) public returns (int256[]) {
        if(accept_trade) {
            msg.sender.transfer(refunds[msg.sender]);
            return trades[msg.sender];
        } else {
            msg.sender.transfer(prepayments[msg.sender]);
            delete trades[msg.sender];
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

The function enables agents to receive or reject their trades. 
In case of an acceptance, the function pay the agents their refund
and returns their belonging granted trade.
As explained earlier, the agents prepay the true value of the entire requested bundle.
However, the agents often only get shares of their requested bundles due to the solution of the 
\textit{market matching problem}.
For this reason, the agents have often prepaid more than they have to pay, which leads to 
excess payments. Because of this, the dealer calculates the difference between the prepayment 
and the price of the granted trade and refunds it.
In case of a rejection, the dealer refunds the whole prepayment and deletes the granted trade.
The deletion of a rejected trade is necessary to calculate the dealer's resource inventory correctly
after the settlement process.


\subsubsection{Off-chain dealer}
\label{sec:off_chain_component}
We mentioned earlier in the section \ref{sec:concept_of_lem} that the 
dealer is implemented by a smart contract and a conventional software client.
In the previous subsection \ref{sec:smart_contract_dealer}, the 
dealer's smart contract was described. In turn, 
this subsection deals with the counterpart, the off-chain dealer. 

Firstly, the off-chain dealer is implemented by a Python class and the 
class attributes are introduced and presented in the listing \ref{lst:offchain_class_attributes} below.
The variables \verb|account_address|, \verb|web3|, 
\verb|dealer_contract|, \verb|shared_resource_size| and \verb|mkt_prices| 
are initialized when the class is instantiated.
Again, the variables \verb|account_address|, \verb|web3| and 
\verb|dealer_contract| have the same purpose as those used in the class implementation of 
the agents, introduced in subsection \ref{sec:agent_class}.
Further, the variable \verb|shared_resource_size| is required to determine the vector size 
of the traded bundles and the related market price vector. 
Additionally, the market price vector is initialized using the \verb|shared_resource_size|
and presented by the variable \verb|mkt_prices|.
All other class attributes are set immediately after 
the instantiation or during the running simulation.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:offchain_class_attributes, caption=Overview of the off-chain dealer's class attributes, language=Python]
    class Dealer(object):

        def __init__(self, account_address, web3, dealer_contract, shared_resource_size):
            self._account_address = account_address
            self._web3 = web3
            self._dealer_contract = dealer_contract
            self._resource_inventory = None
            self._trade = None
            self._shared_resource_size = shared_resource_size
            self._mkt_prices = np.zeros(self._shared_resource_size)
            self._order_handler = None
\end{lstlisting}

Next, some of the most important functions of the class are introduced and explained.
To begin with, the function to retrieve the orders of the agents from the dealer's 
smart contract is introduced in the listing \ref{lst:offchain_get_orders}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:offchain_get_orders, caption=Retrievement of orders, language=Python]
    def get_orders(self):
        self._order_handler = utils.OrderHandler()
        order_indices = self.get_order_indices()

        # get all orders from contract and store in order handler
        for order_id in order_indices:
            order = self._dealer_contract.contract.functions.getOrder(order_id).call()
            self._order_handler.add_order(order_id, order)
\end{lstlisting}

The variable \verb|order_handler| is initialized with an object of the class \verb|OrderHandler|.
We developed the class \verb|OrderHandler| to store and manage the orders of the agents' more easily
on the part of the off-chain dealer.
It contains a pool for the account addresses of the agents and the 
respective orders. In addition, the object provides functions to 
calculate all relevant attributes regarding the trades of the belonging orders, 
like the prepayment and the refunds.
Then, the function of the smart contract is called to retrieve the order indices,
which is stored in the variable of the same name. This variable is used to 
access the individual orders of the smart contract.
Afterwards, all orders from the contract are retrieved iteratively and stored in the \verb|order_handler|.

Furthermore, the class also provides functions for creating and solving the \textit{market matching problem}.
Due to the focus on the architectural design and implementation of the simulation and the high complexity
of these functions, they are not presented in detail. However, the corresponding source code can be found in the appendix \ref{appendix:additional_offchain}.

Finally, the function to set the trades of the agents in the contract is presented in the listing \ref{lst:offchain_set_trades}.
In the beginning, several functions are invoked which initiate the calculation of trades and their related attributes.
All these calculations take place in the object \verb|OrderHandler|, which has already been presented.
First, the calculation of the trade share is called. As stated earlier, due to the solution of the 
\textit{market matching problem}, the agents often just get shares of their requested bundles. In this step,
these shares for each settled order are set. Then, the calculation of the respective trades is initiated.
Then again, the calculation of the remaining attributes, such as the prepayment, the bill, and the refund,
is initiated. 
After that, all required attributes of the trades are calculated.


\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:offchain_set_trades, caption=Submitment of trades, language=Python]
    def set_trades(self):
        self.set_trade_share()
        self.initiate_trade_calculation()
        self.initiate_prepayment_calculation()
        self.initiate_bill_calculation()
        self.initiate_refund_calculation()

        for order in self._order_handler.get_all_orders():
            account, trade, prepayment, bill, refund = order.get_trade_information()
            prepayment = utils.from_ether_to_wei(prepayment)
            bill = utils.from_ether_to_wei(bill)
            refund = utils.from_ether_to_wei(refund)

            self._dealer_contract.contract.functions.setTrade(account, trade, prepayment, bill, refund).transact({'from': self._account_address})
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, the respective orders are set iteratively in the dealer's smart contract. For each existing order, the related values of 
\verb|prepayment|, \verb|bill| and \verb|refund| are again converted from Ether to Wei. Then, the object of the smart 
contract dealer is used to invoke the contracts function to set the trades.


\subsubsection{Blockchain}
In this part, the used blockchain is described. At the beginning, in section \ref{sec:applied_technologies}, we already
stated that we used a personal blockchain called Ganache. 
This personal Ethereum blockchain acts like a full client, which is described in section \ref{sec:nodes}.
However, Ganache has even more features that allow you to customize the properties of the Blockchain.
First, you can specify the number of generated accounts and the assigned amount of ether.
Further, it is possible to adjust the block time. The block time defines the time it takes to mine a new block. 
Additionally, it provides the feature to instantly mine a new block for every transaction. 
This is very useful for testing and debugging applications like the developed simulation.
Likewise, it is possible to specify the price of gas in Wei and the gas limit of a block. 
Hence, the used blockchain Ganache allows you to recreate many scenarios of different blockchain behavior
and is therefore perfectly suited for the application of a simulation.


\subsection{Simulation process}
To begin with, this subsection presents the whole simulation process. 
In contrast to the previous subsection \ref{sec:components_of_simulation}, that 
considered the individual components in isolation, this subsection focus 
on the interaction of the various components.

Further, we divided the simulation process into 
the two parts \textit{Initial Setup}, and \textit{Main simulation loop},
which are described in the following.

\subsubsection{Initial setup}
Above all, the initial setup part is shown in the listing \ref{lst:initial_setup}.
The displayed source code is executed directly before the source code from listing \ref{lst:main_simulation_loop}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:initial_setup, caption=Initial setup of the simulation, language=Python]
    # general setup of simulation
    var = mem.Variables()
    lp.decompose(var)

    # set initial inventory and market prices
    var.dealer.set_resource_inventory()
    var.dealer.set_mkt_prices()  
\end{lstlisting}

Firstly, an object of the class \verb|Variables| is instantiated. 
This class object can be seen as a kind of global memory.
It contains all fundamental variables which are required to run the simulation.
These variables are described in more detail in the following list.

\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{central\_problem}:] Represents the specified central optimization problem of the presented \textit{BTM}.
    It is divided into subproblems and distributed to the existing agents. It is important 
    to note that the number of variables present in the problem can be exactly divided by the number of agents.
    Otherwise, an exception is thrown.
	\item[\texttt{web3}:] Represents the object of the Python library, which enables the interaction with an
	Ethereum blockchain. It is the same object that is passed to the agent classes and the off-chain dealer class.
    \item[\texttt{dealer\_contract}:] Represents the object of the dealer's smart contract. 
    It is the same object that is passed to the agent classes and the off-chain dealer class. It contains all the
    implemented functions of the dealer's smart contract. When the contract is deployed and thus anchored in the blockchain, a JSON file is created. 
    This file is denoted as the Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI). The Contract ABI is used to instantiate the Python object.  
    \item[\texttt{agent\_pool}:] Represents a list containing all existing agent objects. 
    Therefore all existing accounts are read from the blockchain and used to instantiate the agents.
    \item[\texttt{dealer}:] Represents the object of the off-chain dealer, which is instantiated with the 
    remaining account.
\end{description}

Next, the function for decomposing the central problem is called. The class object \verb|Variables| is passed to it as a parameter.
This is needed to reach the central problem, the agent pool and thus the amount of all existing agents, and the object of the
off-chain dealer. 
Then, the central problem is decomposed into subproblems which are distributed among the agents. 
The distribution step also includes the distribution of the shared resources. 
Further, the allocation of the shared resources is implemented in such a way that all parties receive equal shares.

Furthermore, the off-chain dealer sets the initial values of the resource inventory and the market prices in the dealer's
smart contract. As stated before, the initial resource inventory is calculated in the decomposition step of the central problem. 
We also mentioned earlier in \ref{sec:off_chain_component}, that the market price vector is initialized when instantiating the off-chain dealer class.
The size of the market price vector is equal to the size of the shared resources and is initially specified with zeros.

Finally, a few simulation parameters are set, which are needed to determine the termination of the simulation.
These are self-explanatory and not essential for understanding the simulation process, wherefore they are not shown in the listing \ref{lst:initial_setup}.
Afterwards, the main simulation begins.

\subsubsection{Main simulation loop}
First of all, the source code of the \textit{Main simulation loop} is outlined in the listing \ref{lst:main_simulation_loop}.
These loop represents the main process of the simulation and takes place after the part \textit{Initial Setup}.
The simulation loop is implemented by a while loop, which only terminates if the 
market prices from the previous round are equal to the market prices of the current round.
Conversely, this means that the simulation runs as long as the market prices of the last two rounds are different.
Additionally, there are comments in the source code of listing \ref{lst:main_simulation_loop}.
The inline comments to the right of the function calls indicate if the invoked function constitutes
a \verb|call()| or a \verb|transact()| method. As described earlier, the \verb|call()| method invokes 
a smart contract function on a read-only basis, whereas the \verb|transact()| method submits a verified transaction 
that changes the state of the blockchain.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htbp, label=lst:main_simulation_loop, caption=Main loop of the simulation, language=Python]
    while(not equal_market_prices):
        
        # agent bidding
        for agent in var.agent_pool:
            agent.get_mkt_prices()  # call
            agent.determine_bundle_attributes()
            agent.set_order()  # transact

        utils.wait_for_new_block(var)

        # dealers market matching mechanism
        var.dealer.get_orders()  # call
        var.dealer.create_mmp()
        var.dealer.solve_mmp()
        var.dealer.set_trades()  # transact
        var.dealer.delete_order()  # transact
        var.dealer.set_mkt_prices()  # transact
        var.dealer.set_mmp_attributes()  # transact

        utils.wait_for_new_block(var)

        # agent trade verification
        for agent in var.agent_pool:
            agent.verify_strong_duality()  # call
            agent.accept_trade()  # transact
            agent.add_trade_to_shared_resources()

        utils.wait_for_new_block(var)

        var.dealer.recalculate_resource_inventory() # transact        
\end{lstlisting}

The behavior of a blockchain differs from that of conventional client-server architecture.
In a blockchain environment, the process of a \verb|transact()| method call is not immediately completed.
The network verification requires some time due to the mining procedure. 
Consequently, before the values written into the blockchain by a \verb|transact()| method are accessible, a certain time passes.
Hence, it is important to take this into account if you want to read certain values 
from the blockchain that you set in previous steps. 
Therefore, we implemented a function called \verb|wait_for_new_block()|. This function
simply waits for the generation (mining) of a new block and 
is invoked whenever it is needed to wait for new values to be finally anchored in the blockchain.

In addition, the \textit{Main simulation loop} can be divided into the three main activities 
\textit{agent bidding}, \textit{dealer's market matching mechanism}, and \textit{agent trade verification},
which are also marked with a comment in the listing \ref{lst:main_simulation_loop}.
These main activities are thematically summarised function calls.
Besides, the above described function \verb|wait_for_new_block()| is called between these activities
to ensure a faultless process. 
In the following, each of the three activities is described.

\paragraph{Agent bidding:}
To start with, this activity refers to section \ref{sec:agent_bidding} of the same name and represents
the technical implementation. Further, a sequence of all function 
calls for this activity is provided in figure \ref{figure:agent_bidding_figure}.

Above all, the steps described below are performed for all existing agents. 
This is indicated by the specified for-loop, shown at the beginning of listing \ref{lst:main_simulation_loop}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{./figures/agent_bidding.png}
	\caption{Sequence of agent bidding}
	\label{figure:agent_bidding_figure}
\end{figure}

First, the agent gets the current market prices from the dealer's smart contract.
To obtain the market prices, the function \verb|getMktPrices()| of the dealer's smart contract is utilized.
The market prices are required for the determination of the preferred bundle set.

Next, the agent solves the bundle determination and initialize the class attributes
\verb|bundle_set| and \verb|bid|.
In turn, they are required for the next function call.
The corresponding implementation of this function is presented in listing \ref{lst:determine_bundle}.

Finally, the agent sets the order in the dealer's smart contract.
To place the order in the contract, the function \verb|setOrder()| of the contract is utilized.
The implementation of the dealer's smart contract function is shown in the listing \ref{lst:set_order_contract}.
Moreover, the implementation of the function \verb|set_order()| of the agent is 
also introduced in the listing \ref{lst:set_order}.

\paragraph{Dealer's market clearing mechanism:}
To begin with, this activity refers to section \ref{sec:market_clearing_mechanism} and can be seen as
the technical implementation. Further, a sequence of all function 
calls for this activity is provided in figure \ref{figure:dealers_mmp}.

First, the off-chain dealer gets the orders from the dealer's smart contract.
Therefore, the function \verb|get_orders()| of the agent (introduced in listing \ref{lst:offchain_get_orders})
utilizes the function \verb|getOrder()| of the contract.

Then, the off-chain dealer creates and solves the market matching problem.
The implementation of both functions is outlined in appendix \ref{appendix:additional_offchain}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{./figures/dealers_mmp.png}
	\caption{Sequence of dealer's market matching mechanism}
	\label{figure:dealers_mmp}
\end{figure}

After solving the market matching problem and the calculation of the respective 
trades, the off-chain dealer sets the trades in the dealer's smart contract.
Therefore, the function \verb|set_trade()| of the off-chain dealer (introduced in listing \ref{lst:offchain_set_trades})
utilizes the function \verb|setTrade()| of the dealer's smart contract.

Afterwards, the off-chain dealer deletes the settled orders out of the dealer's
smart contract. 
To do this, the function \verb|delete_order()| of the off-chain dealer
utilizes the function \verb|deleteOrder()| of the dealer's smart contract.

In addition, the off-chain dealer sets the new market prices in the dealer's smart contract.
To set the new market prices, the function \verb|set_mkt_prices()| of the off-chain dealer 
utilizes the function \verb|setMktPrices()| of the dealer's smart contract.

Finally, the values of the market matching problem are set in the dealer's smart contract. 
They are used by the agents to verify the correctness of the calculated market prices.
Therefore, the function \verb|set_mmp_attributes()| of the off-chain dealer
utilizes the function \verb|setMMPAttributes()| of the dealer's smart contract.

\paragraph{Agent trade verification:}
To start, this activity covers the entire trade verification step of the agent. 
Likewise, a sequence of all function 
calls for this activity is provided in figure \ref{figure:agents_trade_verification}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{./figures/trade_verification.png}
	\caption{Sequence of agents trade verification}
	\label{figure:agents_trade_verification}
\end{figure}

First, the agent verifies if the conditions of the \textit{Strong Duality Theorem}
are fulfilled.
Therefore, the function \verb|verify_strong_duality()| of the agent
(introduced in listing \ref{lst:verify_trade})
utilizes the function \verb|getMMPAttributes()| of the dealer's smart contract.
As mentioned ealier in section \ref{sec:agent_bidding}, this function 
determine the class variable \verb|accept_trade| of type boolean,
which indicates whether the trade is accepted or not.

Afer that, the agent informs the dealer's smart contract whether 
the trade is accepted or rejected.
For this, the function \verb|accept_trade()| of the agent
(introduced in listing \ref{lst:accept_trade})
utilizes the function \verb|acceptTrade()| of the dealer's smart contract
(introduced in listing \ref{lst:accept_trade_contract}).
In case of acceptance, the dealer's smart contract transfers the refunds 
to the agents and returns the respective bundle. Otherwise, in case of  
rejection, dealer's smart contract transfer the whole prepayment 
and deletes the respective trade.

Finally, the agent adds the trade to the shared resources. The invocation
of this function only affects if the trade was previously accepted. \newline

At the end of each iteration, the resource inventory of the dealer is recalculated.
Therefore the off-chain dealer calculates how much of the inventory is used for
the trades and settles this with the previous inventory.
Finally, the new calculated inventory is set in the dealer's smart contract.

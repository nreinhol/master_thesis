\subsection{Blockchain-based Energy Markets}
\label{sec:Blockchain-based Energy Markets}
To start, Mihaylov et al. were the first who addressed blockchain technology in
energy markets. They present a new decentralized digital currency with the aid of
which prosumers trade locally produced renewable energy \shortcite{mihaylov2014nrgcoin}.
In their introduced concept, the generation and consumption of renewable energy is directly
transferable into virtual coins. However, the market value of the virtual currency is determined
centrally by the distributed system operator. Further, Al Kawasmi et al. introduce a blockchain-based
model for a decentralized carbon emission trading infrastructure \shortcite{al2015bitcoin}.
Their model based on the bitcoin protocol and focus on privacy and system security goals.
Besides, they provide a solution to the problem of anonymous carbon emission trading.
Equally, Aitzhan and Svetinovic address the issue of transaction security in
decentralized smart grid energy trading and implemented a proof-of-concept for a
blockchain-based energy trading system including anonymous encrypted messaging streams \shortcite{aitzhan2018security}.
Concluding, they show that blockchains enable the implementation of decentralized energy trading and that the degree
of privacy and security is higher than in traditional centralized trading platforms. Furthermore, Sikorski et al.
present a proof-of-concept where a blockchain enables machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions depicting an
M2M energy market \shortcite{sikorski2017blockchain}. They pointed out that the blockchain technology has
significant potential to support and enhance the 4th industrial revolution. Moreover, \shortciteA{mengelkamp2018designing}
reveal the concept of a blockchain-based local energy market without the need of a thrusted
third entity. In addition, they deduce seven market
components as a framework for building efficient microgrid energy markets. Consequently,
the Brooklyn Microgrid project is introduced and evaluated according to the market components.
As a result, the Brooklyn Microgrid also shows that blockchains are a suitable technology
to implement decentralized microgrid energy markets, though current regulation does not
allow running such LEM in most of the countries. Later on, Mengelkamp et al.
present an initial proof-of-concept of a simple blockchain-based concept, market design and
simulation of a local energy market consisting of a hundred households \shortcite{mengelkamp2018blockchain}.
Finally, they conclude that the real-life realization and technological limitations of such blockchain-based
market approaches need to be investigated by further research. In addition, it is mentioned that regulatory
changes will play an important role in the future of blockchain-based LEM.

\subsection{Distributed Resource Optimization}
\label{sec:Distributed Resource Optimization}
To begin with, Fan et al. outline a new approach for the development of an information system
that can be used for the problem of a supply chain. The concept demonstrates a decentralized
decision-making process that is realized through the design of a market-based coordination
system which incites the participants to act in a way that is beneficial to the overall
systems \shortcite{fan2003decentralized}. Further, Guo et al. revive this concept
and develop a market-based decomposition method for decomposable linear systems,
that can be easily implemented to support real-time optimization of distributed
systems \shortcite{guo2007market}. They prove that the system optimality can be
achieved under a dynamic market-trading algorithm in a finite number of trades.
Moreover, the outlined algorithm can be operated in synchronous and as well in
asynchronous environments. Later on, Guo et al. extend their stated concept to a
dynamic, asynchronous internet market environment \shortcite{guo2012computational}.
Additionally, they examine how various market design factors like dealer inventory
policies, market communication patterns, and agent learning strategies affect
computational market efficiency and implementation. Finally, also this time,
Guo et al. prove finite convergence to an optimal solution under all these different schemes.

\subsection{Competitive Benchmarking}
Firstly, March and Smith describe a two-dimensional framework for research in IS \shortcite{march1995design}.
The two dimensions can be distinguished into behavioral-science and design-science. The behavioral-science
paradigm is based on explaining or predicting human or organizational behavior. Whereas, the design-science
paradigm is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research. It strives to extend the boundaries
of human and organizational capabilities through the creation of new artifacts.

% connection of these two - design science approach by hevner
Furthermore, the research framework presented by \shortciteA{hevner2008design} combines both stated
IT research paradigms and illustrates the interaction between these two.
They present that technology and behavior are inseparable in an information system. Therefore,
they argue that considering the complementary research cycle between design-science and behavioral-science
is crucial to address fundamental problems faced in the productive application of information technology.

% competitive benchmarking include basic principles of hevner
In addition, \shortciteA{ketter2015competitive} introduce the IS research approach called Competitive Benchmarking (CB),
which includes various basic principles of the design science approach of \shortciteA{hevner2008design}.
This IS research concept is designed for so-called wicked problems and address the problems and needs of interdisciplinary
research communities. CB focus on the interconnection of problems at the same and different levels to imitate the real world.
In repeated competitions, in which individual teams compete against each other, the developed environment and models
can be tested and evaluated. This results in a diversity of outcoming designs, which are difficult to achieve in
traditional design science frameworks.

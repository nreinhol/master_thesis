This research provides two different contributions. First, the fully decentralization of the introduced distributed optimization algorithm \shortcite{guo2007market}. 
The bundle-trading market grant access of any given trade to the market dealer. This, again, necessitates trust of the agents that it will use those resources according to the over-arching organizational goal. Due to the implementation of the market dealer by a smart contract, the technical implementation is public accesible. Moreover, all transactions of the market dealer to allocate the resources are transparent. Therefore, the behavior of the market dealer is comprehensible for every participant. Furthermore, it provides a high degree of security due to cryptographic encryption methods which are essential parts of the blockchain.
Second, the open simulation platform itself. From the scientific perspective, the platform is relevant due to the removal of existing technical barriers for practicioners in using complex distributed ledgers technologies. Therefore the platform facilitates researchers without a deep technically background to use those DLTs and incentivises to design and test their artifacts by using this platform. 
On the other hand, from a business perspective, this research is relevant to policy makers and energy suppliers. The platform allows stakeholders to get a better understanding of the dynamics of decentralized LEM and enables the testing and evaluating of policy options and implications.

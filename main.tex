\section*{Abstract}

In this research, an open blockchain-based local energy market simulation platform is developed. The implementation
based on a market-based optimization algorithm, introduced by \shortcite{guo2007market}, that solves a 
distributed system optimization problem by self-interested agents iteratively trading bundled resources in a double auction market.
The underlying information communication technology of the market-based optimization algorithm 
is provided by the emerging blockchain technology.

\section*{Abstract}

Due to the constantly increasing generation from distributed renewable energy resources and the 
difficulties of integrating these energy resources into the existing electric grid, new market approaches
are needed. 
Peer-to-peer energy trading in local energy markets provides a possible solution to the stated issues,
but it requires advanced communication und data exchanges between the different parties, which makes 
central management and operation more and more challenging.
As local energy markets need local distributed control and management techniques, a new and innovative 
information communication technology is required, to which the emerging distributed ledger technology
provides a possible solution.
Therefore, an open blockchain-based local energy market simulation platform is developed in this research.
The implementation
based on a market-based optimization algorithm, introduced by \shortcite{guo2007market}, that solves a 
distributed system optimization problem by self-interested agents iteratively trading bundled resources in a double auction market.
The underlying information communication technology of the market-based optimization algorithm 
is provided by the emerging blockchain technology.
The conducted research provides a decentralized implementation of the proposed market-based optimization algorithm, 
in which the transparency is enhanced and the required level of trust is reduced due to the application of 
the blockchain technology. Furthermore, it provides a detailed explanation of the implementation and deals with 
the special features of the blockchain functionality, whereby technical barriers in using the developed simulation are 
removed and researchers are incentivized to design and test their artifacts by using the developed open blockchain-based 
local energy market simulation platform.
